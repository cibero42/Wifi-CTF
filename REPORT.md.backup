Open WiFi networks are wireless networks in which traffic is not secured or encrypted, users can connect without authentication. They are often found in public places. They are not secured so they pose significant security risks.

Eavesdropping attacks involve the unauthorized interception of communication between two parties from which the attacker gains access to sensitive information.

There are many types of eavesdropping attacks:

    Physical Eavesdropping: This involves directly accessing communication lines or physical devices to intercept data. For example, attackers might tap into telephone lines or place listening devices (bugs) in physical locations to capture conversations.

    Network Eavesdropping: In network eavesdropping attacks, attackers intercept data transmitted over a network. This can be done by capturing and analyzing network traffic using packet sniffing tools. Attackers can monitor wireless transmissions to capture sensitive information or launch other types of attacks, such as session hijacking or Man-in-the-Middle attacks.
    
Forms of eavesdropping attacks: 

    Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks: In a MitM attack, the attacker intercepts communication between two parties, allowing them to eavesdrop on the conversation or manipulate the transmitted data.

    Packet Sniffing: Packet sniffing involves capturing and analyzing data packets transmitted over a network. Attackers can use packet sniffers to eavesdrop on sensitive information, such as login credentials or personal messages.

    Evil Twin Attacks: In an Evil Twin attack, the attacker sets up a rogue access point with the same SSID as a legitimate WiFi network. Users unknowingly connect to the rogue access point, allowing the attacker to intercept their traffic and potentially eavesdrop on their communication.
