# Wireless Hack The Flag
**Télécom SudParis NET4104**

This project aims to teach the common Wi-Fi vunerabilites, using a cool Hack The Flag game.
You can find all instructions and explanations [here](https://github.com/l4ti/TSP-NET4104-HackTheFlag/blob/main/REPORT.md) and all automation attack shell scripts can be found [here](https://github.com/l4ti/TSP-NET4104-HackTheFlag/blob/main/scripts)

## Objective
 - Set-up configuration
 - Explain attacks using Kali Linux (tbd, around 5)
 - Automation of cited attacks (Shell Scripts)
 - Step-by-step flag capturing

## Known vunerabilities
### OPEN
 - [Network Eavesdropping](https://www.fortinet.com/resources/cyberglossary/eavesdropping)
	 + Man in the middle attack: an attacker intercepts and possibly alters communication between two parties without their knowledge. This can be done using tools like Wireshark or Ettercap.
	 + Packet Sniffing: it involves the capturing and analysis of data packets transmitted over a network. 
	 + Evil Twin Attack: the attacker sets up a rogue wireless access point with a name (SSID) similar to a legitimate access point. Users unknowingly connect to the rogue access point, allowing the attacker to intercept their traffic and potentially perform various attacks.
- Rogue Access Point Attack: A rogue access point attack involves the installation of unauthorized wireless access points on a network. These access points can be used to intercept traffic, launch attacks, or provide unauthorized access to the network.
- DNS Spoofing Attack: DNS spoofing involves manipulating DNS responses to redirect users to malicious websites.
- Session Hijacking Attack: Session hijacking involves stealing or impersonating a user's session identifier to gain unauthorized access to their accounts or services.
